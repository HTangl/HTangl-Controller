The HTangl controller is an all digital game controller mainly made for Super Smash Brothers Melee  
but it can be used for many different games including traditional fighting games and platformers.  

It runs on a [modified version](https://github.com/HTangl/HTangl-Firmware) of the [HayB0XX firmware](https://github.com/JonnyHaystack/HayB0XX).  

The design of the controller is based on [The B0XX](https://b0xx.com/), [Frame 1](https://frame1.gg/) and [GCCMX](https://www.craneslab.xyz/projects/mx)  

This controller is licensed under the CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal. Please read the license in this repository and visit https://ohwr.org/cernohl for more information. This license allows you to make a modified or unmodified version of the controller for yourself or to sell provided you follow the guidelines of the license. The strongly reciprocal version of the license I have chosen requires that you use this same license if you decide to make modifications to this controller.  

This controller is not especially easy to DIY, Version 2 requiers a large 3D printed case which I print all in one piece on a large format FDM printer. The top panel and switch plate are also laser cut and the PCB requires some custom parts like the 2 USB ports. If you are not already somewhat familier with 3D printing, soldering, CAD and PCB manufacturing then I do not recommend trying to make one of these controllers.  

I created a simplified version of this controller specifically meant for DIY called the [BudgeTangl](https://github.com/HTangl/BudgeTangl), please check out that repository if you're just looking to make a simple controller.

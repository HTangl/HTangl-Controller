# HTangl-Controller

The HTangl controller is an all digital game controller mainly made for Super Smash Brothers Melee  
but it can be used for many different games including traditional fighting games and platformers.

It runs on a [modified version](https://github.com/HTangl/HTangl-Firmware) of the [HayB0XX firmware](https://github.com/JonnyHaystack/HayB0XX). 

The design of the controller is based on [The B0XX](https://b0xx.com/), [Frame 1](https://frame1.gg/) and [GCCMX](https://www.craneslab.xyz/projects/mx)

DXF, Gerber and Kicad files are all in this repo and you are free to use them to make your  
own version of the controller or a clone. If you're making a clone for resale please credit this repository.

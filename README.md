The HTangl controller is an all digital game controller mainly made for Super Smash Brothers Melee  
but it can be used for many different games including traditional fighting games and platformers.  

It runs on a [modified version](https://github.com/HTangl/HTangl-Firmware) of the [HayB0XX firmware](https://github.com/JonnyHaystack/HayB0XX).  

The design of the controller is based on [The B0XX](https://b0xx.com/), [Frame 1](https://frame1.gg/) and [GCCMX](https://www.craneslab.xyz/projects/mx)  

Design files are all in this repo and you are free to use them to make your  
own version of the controller or a clone. If you are making a clone for resale please credit this repository.

This controller is not especially easy to DIY, Version 2 requiers a large 3D printed case which I print all in one piece on a large format FDM printer. The top panel and switch plate are also laser cut and the PCB requires some custom parts like the 2 USB ports. If you are not already somewhat familier with 3D printing, soldering, CAD and PCB manufacturing then I do not recommend trying to make one of these controllers.  

I created a simplified version of this controller specifically meant for DIY called the [BudgeTangl](https://github.com/HTangl/BudgeTangl), please check out that repository if you're just looking to make a simple controller.
